## What is MergeHub?

MergeHub is a platform that helps developers find the best open-source issues to contribute to — ones where competition is low and the chance of getting your PR merged is high.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of GitHub issues with no signal, MergeHub analyzes repositories and ranks issues based on contribution opportunity.

---

## The Problem

Open-source contribution discovery is broken.

- Thousands of issues with no clear starting point
- Many issues already being worked on by multiple contributors
- No way to know if a repository is actively accepting PRs
- Time wasted searching instead of building

This leads to low PR acceptance rates and discourages new contributors.

---

## The Solution

MergeHub surfaces high-probability contribution opportunities by analyzing:

- **Contributor competition** — how many people are already working on an issue
- **Repository activity** — whether maintainers are actively reviewing and merging PRs
- **Contribution opportunity** — ranking issues most worth your time

---

## Features

- 🎯 **Issue Opportunity Detection** — highlights issues with low contributor competition
- 📊 **Repository Activity Insights** — identifies repositories actively accepting contributions
- ⚡ **Faster Discovery** — go from zero to the right issue in minutes
- 🧹 **Clean Interface** — designed for quick scanning and evaluation

---

## Who Is It For?

- Developers making their first open-source contributions
- Students applying for **GSoC, SoC**, or similar programs
- Engineers looking to build a stronger GitHub profile
- Contributors who want higher PR merge rates
